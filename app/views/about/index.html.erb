  <h3>Jacob Walker</h3>
  <p>
    I am not your average developer. My undergraduate degree is a Bachelors of Science in Business majoring in Management.
    My graduate degree is a Masters of Business Administration with an emphasis on Computer Information Systems. This business
    background gives me a perspective that is uncommon among developers. I can understand and appreciate business problems
    and processes. I can communicate effectively and often serve as an Operations-to-Programming translator. I have a pleasant
    personality and get along well with almost everyone. *
  </p>
  <p>
    I have been programming since high school and have been enthused about technology since well before that. Although I do
    not have a degree in computer science I have taken a multitude of networking, programming, and systems analysis courses.
    I have been working professionally as an applications developer since 2010 and I dedicate the majority of my free time to
    learning more about technologies.

  <h3>Matthew M. Keeler</h3>
  <p>
    Continual education and self-improvement have always been passions of mine.  Being a developer, this is especially important.
    I spend the vast majority of my time pursuing a deeper understanding of core design principles, application architecture,
    and various technologies.  As a client, you will directly benefit as my research leads to more cost effective, innovative
    solutions with shorter turn-around times.
  </p>
  <p>
    With over half a decade of professional experience, and an equal amount of work in academia, my exposure to a wide range
    of problem spaces ensures I have a solid foundation to approach any subject matter with which you may require assistance.
    Having worked closely with both programmers and non-technical persons over the years, I have proven myself to be
    invaluable during collaboration and requirement gathering meetings.  I look forward to working closely with you as we address
    your technology needs.
