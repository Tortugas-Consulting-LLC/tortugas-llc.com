Young Life Wichita is a local chapter of Young Life, a Christian youth ministry organization.

We created a dynamic website for Young Life Wichita using Ruby on Rails to help them connect with students, share updates, and manage their events and programs. The site serves as a vital communication tool for their ministry in the Wichita area.
